This was developed as a travel guide for a vacation island. I Recieved an excel sheet of travel data that I used to create 4 user personas for the website. The PDF of the data, personas, low-fidelity wireframe, and guerilla testing is attached.

Here is the link to the high-fidelity website: https://LordRevy.github.io/index.html
